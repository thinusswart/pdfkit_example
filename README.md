# Creating PDF files with pdfkit

This is a simple example repo with a few code snippets you can use to create PDF files with [pdfkit](https://pypi.org/project/pdfkit/).

# Getting up and running

1. Clone the project from Github
2. Create a virtual environment using `python3 -m venv .venv`
3. Activate the virtual environment: `source .venv/bin/activate`
4. Install the required modules: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Install [wkhtlmtopdf](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/downloads.html) 
6. Run `main.py`

Your Linux or Windows environment may be different from mine, so anything from Python variables, system paths, environment variables and/or the availability of `pip` might differ.

YMMV.

This is merely an example project for myself and others to play with, not a product that needs to install perfectly every time.
